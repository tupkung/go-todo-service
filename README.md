# Go Todo Service
This project is applied from the demo of Mr.Florin Patan. He spoke to the GopherCon UK 2018 [(**How I Built Microservices In Go In 30 Minutes**)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bM6N-vgPlyQ).

I applied some ideas from him and create this project.

## How to start
1. run docker-compose command
> sudo docker-compose up -d
2. go to https://localhost:8080

## How to stop
run docker-compose command
> sudo docker-compose down
